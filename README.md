# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install --save-dev hardhat 
yarn hardhat 
/* create a basic project*/
yarn hardhat compile
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

```
